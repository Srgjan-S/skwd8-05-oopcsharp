# Homework

```csharp
Like we discussed, you should create a method that will return a List<Movie>
with at least 10 movies by your choise, with the same properties as we worked on the class.
```
```csharp
According to that list you should implement following operations using LINQ:
  * Find all movies that their titles starts with "L"
  * Find the NUMBER of movies that have rating higher than 7.5
  * Find all movies TITLES with year of production before 2005
  * Find all movies TITLES and RATING that have rating higher then 8.0
  * Find first 5 movies that have duration time longer then 2 hours
  * Find last 3 movies TITLES and DURATION that have duration less then 2 hours
  * Find all movies TITLES and RATING and order them by DURATION (DESC) - no condition needed
  * Find all movies with TITLES that don't start with A and TITLES include more than 7 characters
  * Find all movies RATINGS that have RATINGS higher than 7.2, DURATIONS less then 1hour
    and 50min
  * Find all movies TITLES and RATINGS that have TITLES with less than 10 characters, DURATION
    longer than 2 hours, RATING higher then 6.7 and order them by TITLE (ASC)
```
