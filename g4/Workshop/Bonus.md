#### 2. Make a new class `CEO` that inherits from `Employee` that will have a properties:
* `Employees` ( an array of Employees), 
* `Shares` property ( int ), 
* `SharesPrice` ( double )
#### The shares price `should not be` accessed from outside of the class

#### 3. There should be a method called `AddSharesPrice()` that will accept a double number and it will change the `SharesPrice`. This is the `only way` to change `SharesPrice`

* ceoName.PrintEmployees() and 
* ceoName.GetSalary() 
#### to check if everything is working. ‚úî
